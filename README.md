# Welcome to my dotfiles!

These are my dotfiles meant to streamline my work in Mac.

## Main Components:

### Karabiner-Elements:
- Uses my modified mxstbr/karabiner repo to setup and update karabiner keybindings
- Instructions on how it works are on the karabiner-setup folder
- Just run yarn watch after stowing and watch the magic happen in real time

### Areospace
- i3 like windows manager
- Config is mostly plain, alternating between stacked( acordeon with 0 padding) and tiles (split V or H)
- Keybindings are set here but never directily used, they fall under the "w" sublayer in Karabiner, mostly the swaping of windows, resizing, etc
